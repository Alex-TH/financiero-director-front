#### Preparing for Development

You need to run:  

```
npm install
npm start
```

The `start` command would create a development server that listen for changes on the code and refresh
the browser.  

#### Test
To run tests you need to run the next command:  

```
npm test
```
For each feature it is required to write the necessary test cases to validate the feature.

#### Production build

Simply run:  

```
npm run build
```

this would create the bundle file on the `dist/` folder.
